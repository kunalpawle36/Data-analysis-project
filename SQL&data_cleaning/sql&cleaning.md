# SQL and Data Cleaning

The raw data from the classicmodels database was already relatively clean upon inspection.

Minimal data cleaning was necessary, focusing on verifying data integrity and handling any minor inconsistencies.

I have created several SQL views to facilitate data analysis and reporting.

These views aggregate and present data from multiple tables without altering the original raw data.

Examples include views for total sales by customer, product performance summaries, and employee office distributions.

The views are defined in the accompanying SQL file for easy reference and execution.

This approach ensures data preservation while providing convenient access to derived insights.

All view creations and any cleaning steps are documented in this folder.

The process maintains the integrity of the original dataset for future analyses.
